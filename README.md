# Overview

This repository contains a custom modification for the game Minecraft that introduces new content, including items, blocks, and entities with custom AI. The mod is fully developed in Java using Visual Studio Code, with assistance from Codeium for AI, and BlockBench for 3D modeling. All content in this mod is entirely fictional and has no connection to real-world individuals, stories, or universes. It is an original creation made for fun and as a personal hobby, please enjoy it with an open mind.

This is a passion project created by a **beginner modder** and is a **work in progress**. Some features may be experimental, and occasional issues such as lag or bugs may occur.

You can find and download the mod on CurseForge:
